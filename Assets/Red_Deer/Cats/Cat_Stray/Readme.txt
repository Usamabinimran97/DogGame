Hello!

Thank you for choosing my asset!

This asset has a cat model with animations and objects to create its environment. 
Movement animations are presented in two types: in place (ending in _IP) and root movement (ending in _RM). 
Animations that involve cycling are divided into a start, a cycling part, and an end to make it easy to customize.
The animator controller is missing, as are the other scripts.

Recommended! Before you start making an animator controller or use a pre-made one, review all the animations. I tried to create animations for all occasions.

If you have any suggestions on the model, questions or problems with my models, write to me by mail, I will answer within one day:RedDeer3D@gmail.com
